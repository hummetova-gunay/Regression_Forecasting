When splitting the data for training and testing there are two types of errors can occur:

- Bias: how much the model fails to capture the relationship in our train data. 
Low bias -> would fit training data well. 
High bias -> model would not fit our train data very well


- Variance : How well the model performs on our test set
Low Variance -> Model tends to perform as well on our test set as it does on the train set
High Variance -> Model tends to perform poorly on out-of-sample data

Overfit model has low bias, high variance

Well-fit model has medium bias, medium variance

Underfit model has high bias, low variance
