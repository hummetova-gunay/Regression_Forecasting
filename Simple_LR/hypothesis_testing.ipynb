    "**F-statistics** - ratio in statistics that compares the variance between groups(explained variance) to the variance within groups (unexplained variance). a large F - value (>>1) means the model is useful (reject null), small F value means reject null. When we say `.summary` we can see F-statistics and Prob(F-statistics). They will help us decide whether we should make changes in our model or not. We use F-stastics to calculate p-value which is easier to interpret. \n",
